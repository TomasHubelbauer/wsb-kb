# Windows Sandbox Knowledge Base

## USB

USB doesn't seem to be passed through to the Sandbox at all. I've filed feedback requesting
this to be a configurable feature in WSB.

## Restarts

Restarting the Sandbox kills it so when installing software, never accept the restart prompt.

## Configuration

There are WSB launcher files where you can configure vGPU and networking as well as shared
directories. Unfortunately the paths to the shared directories must be absolute and cannot
be relative to the WSB launcher file. I've filed feedback requesting this to be an option.

## To-Do
